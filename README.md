# DriverPass System Analysis and Design

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their DMV driving exams. The client’s needs included both online practice tests and the ability to schedule, cancel, and manage behind-the-wheel driving lessons. In addition, the system had to provide tools for administrators, instructors, and secretaries to manage accounts, appointments, and records, while keeping information secure and updated with DMV policies. The end result is a system that combines scheduling, testing, and reporting functions into a single online, cloud-based platform.

## Strengths in My Work
One part of my work that I did particularly well was capturing the user’s needs in the diagrams and documents. I translated the interview details and requirements into UML diagrams and requirements lists. This made it easy to see not only what the system needed to do but also how different roles like students, instructors and admins would interact with it. I also did well at simplifying the explanation of technical designs so a client without a technical background could still understand how the system would work.

## Opportunities for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the sequence diagram to show alternative flows more clearly. While I captured the main process well, I could improve the readability by tightening the diagram’s layout and labeling conditions more consistently. This would make it even easier for developers and clients to follow the flow of actions.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the client interview and ensuring that every requirement such as scheduling appointments, taking practice exams, and tracking results was represented in both the use cases and the design diagrams. For example, the business requirement that students must have credits before booking lessons was included in the activity flow. Considering user needs is critical because the success of any system depends on whether it actually solves the client’s problems. If the system doesn’t align with how students, instructors, and admins expect to use it, then even a well-built platform won’t be valuable.

## Approach to Software Design
When designing software, I start by focusing on listening to the client and capturing their requirements in plain language before moving into diagrams or technical models. I use a combination of use case analysis, UML diagrams, and iterative refinement, going back to check that each part of the design directly traces back to a client requirement. In the future, I plan to use strategies such as user stories, mockups, and more iterative feedback loops with stakeholders to confirm design decisions earlier. This helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures the final system truly meets user needs.
